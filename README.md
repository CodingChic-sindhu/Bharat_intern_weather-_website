 # Project Overview: Weather 
 
The Weather Fetcher Website is a dynamic, user-friendly web application designed to provide users with real-time weather updates for any location. 
Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project leverages the power of a weather API (such as OpenWeatherMap) to fetch and display current weather
conditions, including temperature, humidity, wind speed, and a brief weather description.

# Key Features:
User Interface:
  
  HTML: Structuring the website with semantic elements.
  
  CSS: Enhancing visual appeal through modern, responsive design practices, ensuring compatibility across devices.

  JavaScript: Adding interactivity and handling API requests.

  
# User Experience:

Allowing users to search for weather conditions by entering a city name.
Implementing error handling for invalid inputs or failed API requests.

This project showcases the integration of web development skills with external APIs, resulting in a practical tool that offers real-time utility to users.
